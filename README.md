### Ooops, my bad

Due Monday April 10, 2017

Oh noe! I broke the game and accidentally deleted the history from
source control.

I'm not sure how I broke it, I was trying to fix a bug with the right
paddle and then I made another change and now it crashes when I try to
run the game

Get the game running for a 70, fix the paddle bug for a 100. Do nothing
for a 50.
